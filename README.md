# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas,  Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. we extracted and transformed the data, created four CSV files, and then used the CSV files to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. Finally, we loaded the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.
